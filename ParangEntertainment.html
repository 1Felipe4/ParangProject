<h2> What Is Parang? Where Did it Come From?</h2><p>


Parang comes from the Spanish word know as "parranda" (action of merry making, group of serenaders). In Trinidad it refers to folkloric music of Hispanic American origins. In Dominican Republic the music is called "arguinaldo". Parang's origin are controversial. First theory of parang music originted during Christianity of Amerindians by French Clergy Indians in (Spanish) Missions. This does not explain the frequent references to Venezuela and the second theory is that parang music was introduced by Venezuelans imported to work in the cocoa estates which has some merit. Definitely, the close interactions with Venezuelans where parang is also played has matured to a popular form of music not only in Trinidad & Tobago but throughout the Caribbean.
